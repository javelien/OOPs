        "# answer. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and only showing the necessary information to the user. This simplifies interaction with objects and focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: When you use a car, you don't need to know how the engine works internally, only how to operate the steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes. This simplifies your interaction with the car.\n",
        "# Encapsulation: Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. This protects data integrity by controlling access to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: In a BankAccount class, the balance and account number can be encapsulated as private attributes, accessed and modified only through methods like deposit and withdrawal.\n",
        "# Inheritance: Creating new classes (child classes) from existing ones (parent classes). This promotes code reuse by inheriting properties and behaviors from the parent class and adding or modifying them as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: You can create a SportsCar class that inherits from a Car class, inheriting common features like make, model, and year, while adding sports-car-specific attributes like turbocharged engines.\n",
        "# Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on many forms. This allows different objects to respond to the same method call in their own way.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example: A Shape class can have a draw() method, and subclasses like Circle and Rectangle can override this method to draw themselves differently.\n",
